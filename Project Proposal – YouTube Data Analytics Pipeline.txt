Project Proposal – YouTube Data Analytics Pipeline
Team: Kevin Bell, Jake Child, Abel Mkina
Course: CS 6705 – Applied Cloud Computing
Instructor: Prof. Joshua Jensen Due Date: November 16, 2025
1.   Project Overview
Our project will build a cloud-based YouTube analytics pipeline that retrieves trending-video metadata and comment text through the YouTube Data API v3, processes it on AWS, and performs descriptive and predictive analytics.
The system will: 
* Collect daily “most popular” videos by region (U.S., Canada, UK).
* Ingest comment data to determine sentiment (positive / neutral / negative).
* Produce dashboards showing trending categories, geographic patterns, and sentiment distributions.
* Use regression models to predict near-term view growth and engagement trends. 
Deliverables will include a working AWS pipeline, visual analytics dashboards, and a final report describing architecture, data flows, and findings.
